# digitalClock

**A vanilla JavaScript digital clock** project is a program that uses plain JavaScript (without any external libraries or frameworks) to display the current time in a digital format on a webpage. The clock can be set to update in real-time, meaning it will display the current time as the user views the webpage. The project typically involves creating a JavaScript function that retrieves the current time from the user's computer using JavaScript's built-in Date object. This function is then used to update the clock display on the webpage with the current time.

The HTML of the project would consist on a simple div or p element where the clock will be placed. Then, in javascript, the first step is to access that element and store in a variable. Then, using setInterval method, the time can be updated in a specific interval. Each time the interval is reached, the function will update the element's innerHTML with the current time format(ex. hh:mm:ss::ms). Additional features such as the ability to change the time format or color scheme wil be implemented using CSS and JavaScript later in the future.
